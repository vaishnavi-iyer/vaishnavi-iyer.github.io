            <h6 class="docs-header">When i was blocked on a problem and something i did really well!!</h6>
       
            <p>Surprisingly the thing that I did well and the things I didn’t do well are both part of the same project- the Java script racer. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I was able to finish the core essence of the assignment really quick and was able to make the table version of the game. But the most challenging part was to try to make it look like a racing game. It looks like boxes stacked together horizontally and it’s not at all appealing to the eyes. And for someone who doesn’t understand code, solving that in two hours in the first trial means nothing but it definitely makes me feel good.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header"> What problem solving techniques did you use?</h6>
                
            <p>Even before I started the project, I made a quick algorithm to approach the challenge and then went about pseudo-coding it. This really gave me a direction and sped my process.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then I started writing code and did googling for the bits, which I wasn’t sure of. The best thing with a well-developed coding language is that based on our intuition you know if something of this sort would be developed or not or is a work around that you have to create but thankfully I was able to find the right commands and it helped and then for the errors I had, I followed the prompts on the console and fixed the errors.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another thing that I did was that I put in deliberate messages to be console-logged. This was for me to ensure how the code is flowing and is it getting stuck anywhere
            </p>
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">How did you feel throughout the process?</h6>

            <p>I wouldn’t say I was too happy or too sad. It was an adventure that I enjoyed, it had its moments but that’s the challenge, if everything were easy then I wouldn’t get a chance to use my brains :)
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, it was a good learning experience.
            </p>
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">What did you learn?</h6>

            <p>I can say that I know a little more of Java script than I knew a week back. I still have lots to learn. I am always used to making algorithms as it was part of my previous job but coding is a new world :) 
            </p>
            
            <h6 class="docs-header"> How I feel about problem solving techniques and process</h6>
            <p><b>Pseudocode</b></p>
            <p>
            I really like pseudo coding and making algorithms. I have already made lots of algorithms and flow chart at my previous job before and now it’s a second nature for me to break my problems into a logical flow and make flow charts. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Trying something</b></p>
            <p>
            This is also something I do a lot. If I have to introduce something new in my code, I try to make a small demo out of it before I use it in my code and trying to do something always makes me understand things in a better light.
            </p>
            <p><b>Rubber ducky method</b></p>
            <p>
            I do this when I am making flow charts but I haven’t used much yet in the program yet.
            </p>
            <p><b>Reading error messages</b></p>
            <p>This is something that we all have to do and we really don’t have a choice with it if we get an error. I read through the error and try to fix it but if I don’t find a solution quickly, I just google the whole error message, I try not to waste too much time on it trying to solve it myself this is because somethings no matter how hard I think, if I have never come across it, it never rings a bell. It’s like coming across a new word in the dictionary for which even the root word is alien to me no matter how hard I try I still have to go to the dictionary to read it.
            </p>
            <p> <b>Console Logging</b></p>
            <p>
            I have become pretty comfortable with this idea after the racer project as I did use this a lot to make sure I was in the right track.
            </p>
            <p><b>Googling</b></p>
            <p>
            I have been doing a lot of googling as well to understand different concepts and learn new approached and ideas. More than google I think I have used W3schools and stack overflow more but in general a lot of internet help.
            </p>
            <p><b>Asking your peers for help</b></p>
            <p>I think I have no hesitation in asking but the situation and my working schedule is such that I don’t get much opportunity to do that but I am sure once we all start working together in the boot-camp, I’ll be more comfortable with this. And I still have been asking a few questions here and there so its good overall :)
            </p>
            <p><b>Asking coaches for help</b></p>
            <p>
            I haven’t done that a lot yet. I think it’s kind of the last resolution but I will discuss my problems with coaches if I get stuck really badly and don’t seem to get a way out.
            </p>
            <p><b>Improving your process with reflection</b></p>
            <p>
            This is the hardest for me as I am able to make distinctions across my strong and weak points but when it comes to changing it in the next week, I go at a snail’s pace. Not intentional but I guess its lack of time and I just have enough time to dive into the work. And I know that I should get a good perspective before I dive in but it’s just hard for me and I know I’ll soon improve this as well.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header"> JavaScript Array Functions</h6>

            <p><b>.map()</b></p>
            <p> This function provides array callbacks for each and every element of the array and stores the result in an array. For e.g. if I want to multiple each element of any array with 2 then i can use the map funtion and the result array will have all elements in array multiplied by 2</p>

            <p><b>.filter()</b></p>
            <p>This array function will test each element of the array for a criteria and if this criteria is met by the element then store it in the result array.</p>

            <p><b>.reduce()</b></p>
            <p>This function applies an accumulator to each element in the array and the result is a single element. For e.g. if you want to add all elements of an array, instead of calling each element and addign them manually, this can be used to add all elements at once. </p>
