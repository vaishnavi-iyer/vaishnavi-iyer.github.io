            <h6 class="docs-header">What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.?</h6>
       
            <p>These days, people use internet and access websites on devices of all sizes and forms, now this is obviously a benefit for the users. However, this is not particularly a boon for the developer.
            </p>

            <p>Imagine the no. of sizes that a possible display can be of and imagine coding for all devices individually and maintaining it. If you add one feature on a page then how many countless device, you will need to duplicate the code.
            </p>

            <p>This problem can be solved by something called responsive design. Responsive design is a design fundamental that is based on the idea that the design itself should incorporate the needs of devices of different sizes.  And this can be done by using the same code with a little device specific tweaks here and there.
            </p>

            <p>Having a responsive design will save a lot of time, effort and money in writing the same code again and again. Also, it will save making repetitive errors and the countless man hours spent in correcting those errors
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h6>
                
            <p>Making a design as per large size page, makes it hard to rescale it for it to be able to into a small screen. However, it is comparatively easy to rescale size to fit a larger screen.
            </p>

            <p>Think of an analogy, if you have a small house, when you move into a bigger house, you are able to fit all your stuff very easily and have room for more new things. However, if you are moving from a big house to a smaller house then all your stuff will be still packed up in boxes and will be all over the place and sometimes you might even have to get rid of a lot of stuff. It’s the same with designing a page… a room is the screen size and all your stuff are various elements on the screen.
            </p>

            <p>Hence if you start with the small house, relocating is easy and similarly starting with designing for a small display and moving up from there is comparatively easy.
            </p> 

            <h6 class="docs-header">What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h6>

            <p>Frameworks are a set of code templates. Some frequently used bits of code is put into the framework so that the developer doesn’t have to redo the whole thing again and again.
            </p>

            <p>Consider the analogy, you are trying to make a burrito at home and you get the readymade tortilla and pre-cut vegies, some canned beans and salsa from the super market and all you have to do is assemble it at home for a yummy burrito.
            </p>

            <p>Framework is all the ready-made stuff and the yummy burrito is the awesome webpage. As a good designer all you have to do is to use the frameworks properly.
            </p>

            <p>This has a number of advantages:
              <ul>
                <li>It’s easier to make the website when you have a few bits ready and tried and tested. </li>
                <li>It is faster. </li>
                <li>Clean and tidy code. </li>
                <li>Can teach you some practices and coding conventions. </li>
                <li>Browser compatibility and known problems are already addressed
                Helpful if many people are working on same code.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p> And everything has a con…
              <ul>
                <li>Is you don’t know the framework properly, then it can take a while to understand and then use it. </li>
                <li>Code is not optimised. Since we only use the bits that we need, lot of other code is unused.</li>
                <li>Slower learning curve as you are only actually using stuff and not doing much by yourself.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h6>

            <p>Wireframes are basically mock-ups of webpage that can be on a piece of paper or any other graphics tool.
            </p>
            <p> It is not practical to directly code whatever comes into our minds. A good idea is to first create drawings of how you want your page to be and then make a design and then start coding. It’s important to plan our development activities so that we don’t end up doing re-work and wasting time.
            </p>

            <p>Few examples of my wireframes </p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="one-half column category">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Index page for mobile">
              </div>
              <div class="one-half column category">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Blog page for mobile">
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now the same pages on a desktop would look a litle different.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="one-half column category">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Index page for desktop">
              </div>
              <div class="one-half column category">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Blog page for desktop">
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <h6 class="docs-header"> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h6>

            <p>For me, the most difficult part to implement was to find the right class that I wanted to link with my web page. For Skeleton framework, the design elements are made considering the minimum screen size as 550 and below that the layout is a single column and using that with my design was a challenge for me and I ended up having my bits in the CSS file. I need to learn how to use CSS better.
            </p>
