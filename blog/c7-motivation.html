            <h6 class="docs-header">Seeing life through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens</h6>
            
            <p>Pleasure, passion and purpose when it comes to the base line is or leads to happiness and the fact is if I am happy, I can make others around me happy as well.
            </p>
            <p>
            For me all three have equal importance in life and one takes priority over the other depending on the situation. The purpose for me is to enable people around me to be happy and to make sure my skills and intellect are utilized properly and valued.
            </p>
            <p>
            To get this greater good I do things from time to time. At this point of time my passion is to get and give as much as possible from this course. This is one picture but the momentary pleasures I have also make this more interesting and memorable - it adds to the overall experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Like when I am studying and don’t have time to cook and my husband cooks my favourite food. It gives me lot of pleasure and makes me want to worker harder for him, for taking in the trouble. On a normal day I wouldn’t have valued that so much but on this day it means that he cares for something that I want to do. It is just momentary pleasure but it adds value to my passion and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
            I think if I have to pick a purpose for my life at this point of time, it is hard and if you ask me to exactly pinpoint it then I am afraid I have no answer for that yet….
            </p>
            <p>
            I am exploring as much as I can and when I am sure that I ready to share my experiences and motivate people to get to their dreams then I think that I have fulfilled my purpose and whatever it takes to do that is my passion and once in a while I treat myself to the small pleasures that life has to offer to keep myself going.
            </p>
            
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">My core values and what I stand for:</h6>
            <p>I believe that there are somethings that you don’t want to compromise with and these define you as person.
            </p>
            <p>
            If I were to name a few of them that really matter to me, then they are:
            </p>
            <p>
            Humanity, Honesty, Humility, Happiness, knowledge, wisdom, Compassion, Hardwork, Family, Freedom, Equality.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">How did I feel about the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h6>


            <p>
            Resilience and the ability to overcome my obstacles by being flexible, strong, rigid, elastic, supple or just plain simple bouncing back is something which is natural to all human beings. But it’s not as easy as it sounds. We need to allow ourselves to come out of our problem and choose a proper method and start moving towards our destination. The most that humans have problem with is to objectify the problem and detach ourselves from it and then think.
            </p>
            <p>
            The whole idea of mindfulness and everything that we have learnt form search inside yourself is “that” means to enable us to do this.
            </p>
            <p> 
            The idea about focusing on our breath and then slowing think about the bad, drawing strength from the bad and then think about the good and get the energy to move forward is something which has worked well with me so far.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am also generally a very optimistic person but sometimes situations put me in a place where I forget about it and go on the other track. But then I just pause and think through it and then comeback up all mighty and strong to take on whatever I have to deal with.
