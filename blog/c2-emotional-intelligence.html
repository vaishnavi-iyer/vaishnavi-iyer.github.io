            <h6 class="docs-header">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h6>
            <p>
                The most important leaning for me from the chapter is that EQ is trainable. Why this is important to me is because I feel that I need to really work on improving my EQ and the faith/ the conviction that it is trainable is hence, very important.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have to work on developing high resolution awareness of developing awareness as soon as they arise. And for this I have to practice Mindfulness.<br>
                - I shall start by paying more attention to my thoughts and emotions.<br>
                - I will consciously try to keep my mind in the present in all my day to day activities.<br>
                - If I have any distractions then I will try and recover from them promptly.<br>
                - Develop emotional stabilisation by trying to reflect on doing it before I do it.<br>
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h6>
            <p>
                I tried meditation and it was not easy for me. I wanted mind brain to just be as is where is and not to think about anything but as you can figure out it didn’t work well for me... I kept on going back to thoughts that I haven’t spoken to mom and dad today, what is that I’ll make for dinner, and how did my sisters exam go today….
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I thought instead if aiming for the blank I’ll start by focussing on my breathing, and to make sure that I don’t waver I started counting my breathing and kept my closed eye focused on my nose (if that’s even possible... ). I think I must have counted till about 70 and then I don’t know why I stopped counting but I was in a vacuum and sometime after that my timer went off and that’s when I felt that it went of pretty fast and I would have liked to be in that state for some more time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am going to try and practice this every day from now on…
            </p>
            <p> 
                <em>And yes for people who find it hard, try counting your breathe … it surely helps.</em>
