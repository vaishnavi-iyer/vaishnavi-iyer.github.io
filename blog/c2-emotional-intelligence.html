      <h2> <u> Emotional Intelligence </u> </h2>      
      <h3>Date: <em>17<sup>th</sup> April 2016</em></h3>
      
      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>
          The most important leaning for me from the chapter is that EQ is trainable. Why this is important to me is because I feel that I need to really work on improving my EQ and the faith/ the conviction that it is trainable is hence, very important.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have to work on developing high resolution awareness of developing awareness as soon as they arise. And for this I have to practice Mindfulness.<br>
          - I shall start by paying more attention to my thoughts and emotions.<br>
          - I will consciously try to keep my mind in the present in all my day to day activities.<br>
          - If I have any distractions then I will try and recover from them promptly.<br>
          - Develop emotional stabilisation by trying to reflect on doing it before I do it.<br>
      </p>

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
          I tried meditation and it was not easy for me. I wanted mind brain to just be as is where is and not to think about anything but as you can figure out it didn’t work well for me... I kept on going back to thoughts that I haven’t spoken to mom and dad today, what is that I’ll make for dinner, and how did my sisters exam go today….
      </p>
      <p>
          Then I thought instead if aiming for the blank I’ll start by focussing on my breathing, and to make sure that I don’t waver I started counting my breathing and kept my closed eye focused on my nose (if that’s even possible... ). I think I must have counted till about 70 and then I don’t know why I stopped counting but I was in a vacuum and sometime after that my timer went off and that’s when I felt that it went of pretty fast and I would have liked to be in that state for some more time.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am going to try and practice this every day from now on…
      </p>
      <p> 
          <em>And yes for people who find it hard, try counting your breathe … it surely helps.</em>
      </p>
