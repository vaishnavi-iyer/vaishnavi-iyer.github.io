            <h6 class="docs-header">What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h6>

            <p>I have two particular experiences on both ends of this equation that have meant a lot to me...
            </p>
            <p>When I joined the company I work for, I was advised that I will have to work different shifts and this being my break in the industry in a new place, I was happy to oblige just for the given opportunity. True to my words, I accepted the shift given to me however, somewhere deep down I was upset that my days off and shift were different from my husband. We could meet each other only for a couple of hours in a day and different days off didn’t help the cause either. I and my manager were just having a casual chat one day and I happen to tell her this. She then changed my days off to match my husband‘s day off so that we could spend more time together. I still work the same hours and it didn’t really make much difference to her but for me, it meant a lot. I try to reciprocate that gesture at every opportunity I get. 
            </p>
            <p>On another note, the previous company I was working for back in India, one of my team mates happen to be my best friend as well. After sometime, I got promoted to be the Team Lead, and my best friend became my team member, I was really worried that it might affect our friendship but I think my instincts with managing the team helped me and never came in the way of my work or our friendship. I was able to keep both part of my life separate and act according to the demand of the situation and now after 4 years, we both have left the job in that company but we are still best friends.
            </p>
                      
            <h6 class="docs-header">Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h6>
            <p> It feels good to be able to add value and contribute to the goodness of this world. After doing this, I felt a sense of calm that is hard to describe, I felt fresh and more energetic to take any challenge head on. I hope my good ness finds its way into someone and is helpful to them.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header"> Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h6>

            <p> It was not as easy to do this as the previous exercise, when  I was about to inhale the back gooey things, my logical brain kept asking me why do I want to do this, my brain only answered saying that the I need to finish the assignment and hence I needed to do it. It started off with being exhaustive, but over a few days, it added a sense of calm, I started to feel more confident, with myself that I can do it but i think it will be some more time before I actually master it.
            </p>

           <h6 class="docs-header">How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to boot camp? </h6>
           <p> <b>Status</b>- Coming to EDA was a big decision that I have taken and I have certain expectations from myself. I am not too sure if I can term it as status but I would definitely want myself to live up to my expectations. So far, in phase -0 I think I could have done better but that said I still have the boot camp to make up for that.
           </p>
           <p><b>Certainty</b>- I like to have things planned and organised most of the time, but sometimes, I think I perform better when I have impromptu situations. It’s really hard to say that when I am at my best, but I think a balance of both is needed to have a happy life. My journey so far has been the same but I am making sure I try to take it as it comes so that I get to understand my natural reaction to the situation to figure out what’s best for me.
           </p>
           <p><b>Autonomy</b>- In life in general, I have had to deal with both situations and hence I am comfortable with both and can adapt easily into both roles as a lead and as a team. But when I team, I expect it to be a team work and not one person bossing around, That said, my EDA experience has been great so far, I have done most of the assignments by myself and paired up with Michael for the Code Generator, we were to also pair up for the calculator but our schedules didn't work out. Also, I did take help from all others Keas as and when I was stuck. I have tried to answer questions from other people whenever I could and I tried my best to be helpful to Michael in the pair session. I am looking forward to the boot camp to see how it goes.
           </p>
           <p><b>Relatedness</b>- I beg to differ with the SIY here for once as it says our mind perceives everyone as foe by default. I think I am wired a little differently here. I generally think of people as friends unless proven otherwise. I have been through a lot of trouble due to this as well but this is how I naturally function. I think I have tried my best to be as helpful and friendly as I could, but the routine I had, was a little tough and gave me little room to catch up. I think boot camp will be better for me as we all will be together and it will give us more time to communicate better.
           </p>
           <p><b>Fairness</b>- This has always been one of virtues. I have always been very outspoken about anything I find unfair towards me and towards others. In my previous job I was kind of a whistle blower as used to fight for this a lot. But I think that’s also what helped me carve a niche for me. I was respected for who I was. I have some expectations after EDA boot camp ends. I hope that things will be fair to me. I don't expect to be given anything more than I deserve but I definitely won’t accept anything less either. After all the fight for fairness that I have done, I think karma will be with me and my hard work will also be there to vouch for me.
           </p>

           <h6 class="docs-header">Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h6>
           <p>Back in India we were given appraisal every year and this involved a meeting with your manager, I have been lucky to have a chance to sit on either side of the table and it was never easy. But you learn it by doing it and the four discussions that I had, I always felt my self-improving (and always thought my manager was improving as well)
           </p>
           <p>I didn’t get to have a difficult conversation with anyone lately and not that I complain but then it’s just that I don’t have any experience to share here :)
