            <h5 class="docs-header"> <u> Meditation Process </u> </h5>      
            <h6 class="docs-header">Date: <em>25<sup>th</sup> April 2016</em></h6>

            <h6 class="docs-header">How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h6>
            
            <p>The process over product is the perfect way to start learning things and if I be honest then I have been about 80 to 85 percent successful in my endeavour as well.
            </p>
            <p>My website could obviously be better than what it is now but my focus was on learning. There were times when the Virgo in me would demand perfection however, I had to use my meta-attention to bring myself back to do what I am supposed to be doing. 
            </p>
            <p>At some places I did want things to be at least presentable and hence I was giving that extra attention but even that was part of learning things. I didn’t want to just keep moving ahead abandoning everything that I was getting stuck at... so yes at some places I was persistent that I wanted it in a certain way but that was part of the target that I had set in my learning curve for myself.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h6>
            <p>I had a fair idea about meditation since long, as many in my extended family have been practising it for a long time. However, for me it is a means to achieve the ultimate concentration. I get distracted easily and hence meditation is a means to develop that focus and concentration that I lack naturally.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h6>
            <p>I knew that it helps improve the concentration and also boost health and longevity. But the revelation that the brain (neo cortex) is thicker for people practising meditation was something I had no clue about and that it has direct effect on certain diseases.
            </p>
            <p>And that distraction is very important in the process of mindfulness is also something that I never knew about it. For me distraction was always an unwanted guest as I felt others are able to do it and I am not able to and which in turn was more distraction. But the idea to acknowledge, release and return being the main brain exercise is motivating. I think that since its part of training, I will try harder now.
            </p>
            <p>The posture is also something that I always thought should be like the traditional position and the reasoning and justification that why in olden days that position held importance and how we can experiment with it, is news to me.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of phantom limb was something I had never heard about and all about “self” and the ability to modulate or release the sense of self, and the ability to see fluidity in self and the paradox of open awareness and focus awareness is all very interesting. 
            </p>
            <p> <em>I think the chapter 2 has affected me more than I think it has…
            </em></p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h6>
            <p>
                I am going to try and practice this every day from now on…
            </p>
            <p> I am going to practise open awareness and focus awareness and try and experiment with different methods to create my own personalised mind circuit training. And overall work on acknowledge, release and return for a few weeks to see how it fits with me.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">Any other musings?</h6>
            <p>
              I am just so surprised that only two chapters and I came across a wealth of knowledge that I had no clue of and now I am anxious as to what will be there in the next forth coming chapters.
