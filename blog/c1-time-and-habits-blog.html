      <h2> <u> Habits and Time Management </u> </h2>      
      <h3>Date: <em>10<sup>th</sup> April 2016</em></h3>
      <p>
          To be very honest, changing a lot of things at once and struggling though all of them together is not something that I want at this point of time. So I have selected a few techniques that I think will work for me and slowly but steadily I will try and incorporate all those into my life style.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have tried to practise growth mind set vs fixed mind set and I also agree to the idea that “Confidence is a displayed ability” The first day when I started I didn’t want to do much because I felt that it’s too much for me and slowly I realised that I need to jump into the water to learn how to swim, sitting on the shore will not help my cause. And after a few days I could see the difference myself. 
      </p>
      <p>
          I am also taking slow steps at a time and that is working because the small targets that I set for my self is helping me boost my morale and also, I am able to learn that thing properly instead of just skimming through it.
          The Pomodora technique is also something that I have been trying to include just so that I can keep re-aliging myself to my central goal instead of just going into a black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
          All said and done I am still trying to implement these completely and for this I am planning on making it a habit and hence I have that in my to-do for the next week. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Also, who wouldn’t want to be productive so I will try and give that a go as well. :) 
      </p>
      <p>
          I also need to start meditating to keep my focus given the insane schedule I have but I like I said before I am trying to make slow and permanent changes
      </p>
      <p>
          I’ll be back with more experiments and ideas next week… until then xxx
