            <h6 class="docs-header">Date: <em>8<sup>th</sup> May 2016</em></h6>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h6>
            
            <p>Self-Awareness is basically going beyond ones physiology and understanding one’s own self. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            And mindfulness in lay means language is having conscious control over our mind- the way we pay attention to particular things on purpose in the present moment and non-judgementally.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you compare both the definitions, both are essentially talking about the same thing. The stability that gives us the ability to view one-self in third person objectivity.
            </p>
            <p>
            And since mindfulness is trainable, it implies that self-awareness is also trainable and in turn self-confidence is trainable as well. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">• Try at least one of the self-awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h6>
            <p>I tried both the techniques and both are obviously very benefiting however, I think I have developed more liking to body scan technique. I have done body scan almost every day this week and it has really helped me. For me when I did the body scan, it felt like each and every organ was speaking to me, I could feel the body releasing all the pent up energy and I could feel my-self becoming lighter as each organ released their energy. This led to a very important observation, I have been storing lot of negative pent up energy and this is an effective way to release that stored energy. The other thing was that I got a chance to say Thank you to my body. I am not sure how it may sound to other people, but while thanking my body I felt it is responding more to me.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h6>
            <p>My emotions are not me is a very hard concept to put in practice. It’s because we have been used to say that my body and my emotions are me. But I still managed to do this a few times this week. To talk about it in third person really helps in reasoning with the emotions. If they were really me, then it would be hard to reason as I should accept myself and be comfortable but when I say it’s not me then I give myself the opportunity to reason and convince whether it is right for me or not.
