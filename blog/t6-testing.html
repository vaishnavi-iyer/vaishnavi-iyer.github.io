            <p>Scope in literal sense means boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
            As you know, everything everywhere is determined by boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
            The variables in JavaScript is also not an exception to this universal boundary rules. It is classified into two categories.<br>
            a.  Global variables <br>
            b.  Local variables <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Global variables are defined in the main context of the program and is visible throughout the program where as local variables are local to a function and are not accessible outside the function.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is also applicable to functions definitions. If a function is defined in the main loop, it is accessible throughout the code and if it is defined in a function, it is accessible to all the child functions.
            </p>
            <p>
            The best analogy for this would be if a man has made money, his kids and wife have a right to a share, and even grandkids have a right to share but the reverse is not true. Pretty much, scope is the same.
