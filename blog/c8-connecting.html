            <h6 class="docs-header">Date: <em>30<sup>th</sup> May 2016</em></h6>

            <h6 class="docs-header">Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h6>

            <p>I think i have always been using these techniques and for that matter everybody is using them,,, some do it consiously and some do nit subconsiously. We all have friends and some relationships that require us to have trust and sincerity. Even with parents and siblings the only difference here is that the biological relationship is conducive to easily establish and practice these insights.
            </p>
            <p>For me as a person Compassion is something which is very important and the minute I feel that for others, I tend to be more kind and sensitive towards them. However, that said for some people with whom I have had bitter experiences, I tried to practise this more and I feel that it definitely helps my approach towards them but also it gives me a sense of peace and calm that is ard to explain.
            </p>
            <p>The badic fundamental.. treat others the way you like to be treated is something that I was taught at a very young age and this idea also helps me align myself over and over. 
            </p>
                      
            <h6 class="docs-header">Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h6>
            <p> I tried this with one of my very good friends, and it's not the first timeI did it but its been a while that i was able to do it because of my crrent commitments.
            </p>
            <p> The idea that my friend trusts me so much and is willing to share so much of her life is a feeling that i find hard to name, but it makes me happy and wanted. And the minute we had finished the hard conversation, I could feel the weght ebing lifted off her in the way she talked.
            </p>
            <p> I infer that it was ina way good for both of us.
            </p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h6>

            <p> I strongly believe in karma and the belief that the good energy and vibrations have a lot of effect on shaping our lives. Once, i finishes the exercise, i was appy that i could give back so much of good energy to the society. The visualisation of the white light and hte black gooey thing helped me as I found a way to substaniate my positive thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p> Also, karma is the idea that whats goes will come back. And that the good that i have done will be reciprocated by some one some where and will help me is a motivation that will keep me going.
            </p>

           <h6 class="docs-header">Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing. </h6>
           <p> This is one of the most recent experiences, last week, I was very upset because I hadn't spoken to my parents in the four out of the seven days. For others this might not mean much but for me its like a prayer that I do every day. The fact that they were speaking to my toher sister added to my fuel. It was a feeling of being forgotten and not being needed any more.
           </p>
           <p>To be really honest, my logical brain knew that this was not true and the real reason was the situation back home. My mom is not doing well, we have some construction and repair work going on at home and my brother had his final exam of his engineering. And the reason they speak to my sister everyday is that she is living by herself in US and I live with my husband who they know takes very =good care of me that they don't need to worry much.
           </p>
           <p>So I knew this was the scene but i still needed reassurance, I expressed my anger to my husband and he was patient and supportive and reassured me that they are busy and will talk to me once they get time.
