      I have been pondering over and over as to what I should write today… I am not so good at expressing myself when I am writing.... I am more of a talking person. And after lot of thinking I thought I would do what I should have done in the first place. Write whatever I feel like saying... :)
    </p>
    <p>
      For all those of you who might be reading my blog in future… I am really very happy that I got to know about EDA, I am very happy that it exists. The whole idea of digging deep into technology and keeping yourself grounded in what we should be doing in all the schools and colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole programme experience till now has been good for me… The way it is designed to encourage people to work together and that if you want to walk far you need to walk together is something that I have always believed in. 
      The technology aspect of the academy is also looking good for me till now because I am using lot of things now that I had no idea about a few weeks back, so I think it is taking me one step closer to where I want to be. I am very glad that I get to get my hands dirty right from the first day instead of taking notes which I not a big fan of.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all said, I just have a feeling that the check in meetings we have could be a little more elaborative and should have questions that are targeted to individuals. Why I feel this is because some people can be a little introvert and might take a while to come out of their shell and for some others it is not that they don’t want to open up but they don’t know how to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And for people like me it is just natural because of how I am designed :)
    </p>
    <p>
      My impressions and expectations have been clear since I made up my mind to join EDA. I am here to be a developer and meet new people and make friends and EDA is going to help me with that. I am sure there will be a lot of challenges and lots of learning along the way but I am prepared to face them and where I falter, I am sure that people around me will pull me by the ears and get me back on track. (Yea I kind of sometimes need a little dose to get me back on track… I know it sucks but that’s life…)

      This is all from me this week… I am very happy, excited, anxious, nervous, overwhelmed and hopeful all at the same time and I don’t know a word that can describe that state of mind of mine. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is it for this week…xxx
