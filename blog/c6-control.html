            <h6 class="docs-header">Date: <em>15<sup>th</sup> May 2016</em></h6>

            <h6 class="docs-header">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h6>
            
            <p>Self-Regulation is all about making the transition "from compulsion to choice".
            </p>
            <p> 
            As I started growing I have definitely improved a lot but still I experience those moments very in I can feel my whole body shaking with rage. I don’t generally take it out on people I don’t know (which is good) and people who are my targets know me too well so they don’t react, but that doesn’t mean they don’t feel hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
            I always feel bad about it later and I ask for their forgiveness but I still feel bad of what I did. I know I need to change it but “how”, is the part I have always struggled with.
            </p>
            <p>
            This chapter has shown me a way on working with and tame my demons.
            Counting to 10, taking slow deep breathes think about good thinks was something I knew all along and it really helped from time to time but it didn’t seem like a fool proof plan.
            </p>
            <p>
            The SiBerian North Rail Road is something that really piqued my interest. The way the author beautifully described it – Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect and Regulate was all I should have been doing all along. I am sure it is going to stick with me.
            The difference between anger and indignation demonstrates that emotion is how we define it to be, it’s at the end of the nothing but a physiological trigger. 
            </p>
            <p>
            And TRIGGER – that word is also something that caught my attention. I can now be neutral to my emotions that arise out of an action because I know I can classify it as a trigger. And I am able to identify as a mere trigger I know I can deal with it because it is after all a trigger and what I do next will define my emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have also always suffered the problem of grasping and aversion. I keep holding on to my emotions, but I most certainly have to work on Meshing and let the emotions just pass through me and not let it stay with me.
            </p>
            <p>
            There were lot of other things, the principles of dealing with distress and bringing about a cognitive change and making friends with emotions, seeing things objectively are all great tips to really bring about the change and give the final polish to the SBNRR method. I think we all intuitively do it more often than not but to understand it and do it will make it more effective.
            </p>
            <p>
            All said, I still need to work more on it and practice it more to improve my mindfulness. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h6>
            <p>One can determine if an idea is effective only when they put it in to practice and the very reason I was able to say so much about self-regulation was because I tried to practice it.
            </p>
            <p>It released some stress from my body. I could feel myself releasing the unwanted energy back into the world so that it could just go and feed on something else. It is liberating.
            </p>
