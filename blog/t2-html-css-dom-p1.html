      <h2> <u> HTML CSS and DOM -1 </u> </h2>      
      <h3> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>
          W3C defines <em>DOM (Document Object Model)</em> as a platform and language-neutral interface that allows progeams and scripts to synamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
      <p>
          <em> What is the HTML DOM?</em>
          <br>
          The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
          <br>
          The HTML elements as objects<br>
          The properties of all HTML elements<br>
          The methods to access all HTML elements<br>
          The events for all HTML elements<br>
          In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now, what DOM does is not something that we can view can directly however, the Dev Tools is a good interface to view the code after the DOM API has worked on it.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now, "The House" expample is a classic example to explain this.
      </p>
      <p>
          Imagine you are an architect, you made a design model of a house.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now the structural elements of your model like the walls, windows and doors are what html is and the wall color of your model and the small decorative curatins is what css is. So now that the house model is ready, where is DOM and why hasn;t it come into the picture yet?
      </p>
      <p>
          DOM comes into picture after your base is ready.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now imagine this model is very flexible and you can move around the rooms of the model and and you can use ur poster to colors to paint the walls and fabric paint the decorative curtains and move around the staircase. Basically you are moving around the rooms like a jig saw puzzle to create that dream house of yours.... Well this run time renovation is what is DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
          In case of a web page, runtime addtion and modification of your code is facilitated by DOM. All the interacive components of the web page like reading from a text box and detecting a mouse click is also the property of a DOM.
      </p>
      <h3> What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p> Each element that you see on a website has a rectangular outline to it. Visualising the digital design mockups in the form of boxes helps you define the structure of the html code. 
      <br> Boxifying is essentially converting each element in the design mockup into rectangular boxes.
      </p>
      <h3> What is the box model?</h3>
      <p> The box model is a concept in CSS that defines the dimensions of each element in a page. <br> The box model includes: <br> 1. Content in the centre <br>2. Padding <br>3. Border <br>4.Margin 
      </p>
      <p> The dimensions of each of these elements can be modified to achieve the desired layout of a webpage.<im/p>
      <p> The image below visually explains the box model </p>
      <div class="box-model-image">
        <img src="../images/box-model-1.jpg" alt="Box Model Image 1">
        <img src="../images/box-model-2.jpg" alt="Box Model Image 2">
