        Whoever came up with the idea of making us create a blog is a GENIUS. The idea to make us express our feelings and also play around with technology couldn't have been better and the amazing questions are great pointers to show us from where to start.

        My blog is not just an assignment for me its a means to express my thoughts and probably for some one who reads this is in future it might help them visualise what to expect from the course.

        I am sure it will help all of us to read each others blog and give us an idea if we are on the right track....
